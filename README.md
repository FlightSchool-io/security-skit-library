# üé≠ Security Skit Library
Architecting secure coding culture through teachable skits. Real Exploits. Teachable Moments. reproducible workflows.

Welcome to the **Security Skit Library**‚Äîa legacy-grade onboarding system for exploit-aware remediation. Each module dramatizes a real-world vulnerability as a teachable skit, complete with:

üé¨ Narrative-driven exploits that engage and educate

üß† Annotated teachbacks that explain remediation logic

üìú Cornell-style SOPs that scale secure workflows

ü§ñ Copilot critiques that refine AI-generated fixes

This library empowers engineers to become security champions by turning every alert into a teachable moment and every fix into a legacy artifact.

## üì¶ Modules

### üìÅ Path: `Log4Shell/`
- üé¨ `skit.md` ‚Äì _The Curious Logger_: dramatized Log4Shell exploit
- üß† `teachback.md` ‚Äì annotated remediation logic with CodeQL
- üìú `SOP.md` ‚Äì Cornell-style remediation workflow
- ü§ñ `autofix-review.md` ‚Äì Copilot Autofix critique and refinement

> _This module teaches engineers how to detect, patch, and scale Log4Shell remediation using GitHub Advanced Security._

---

## üß† Philosophy

- Every fix is a **legacy artifact**
- Every alert is a **teachable moment**
- Every engineer is a **security champion**

We use GitHub Advanced Security (GHAS), CodeQL, Semgrep, and Copilot to build reproducible systems that teach, patch, and scale.

## üöß Coming Soon

- `SSRF/` ‚Äì _The Overeager Fetcher_
- `JWT/` ‚Äì _Token of Deception_
- `SSTI/` ‚Äì _The Trusting Template_
- `Deserialization/` ‚Äì _The Misguided Mapper_
